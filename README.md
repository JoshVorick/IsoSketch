IsoSketch
=========

IsoSketch is a simple tool for creating and editing isometric drawings. Currently you can only connect dots.

In the future, I plan on adding the option to save, and load drawings.
I also plan on adding an undo and erase line button.
Hopefully, I can add some copy paste features along with a nice UI.
And eventually an ability to import other drawings into your current one (so you can combine drawings).
Of course I'll reorganize the code quite a bit so that I don't hate myself as this becomes a more complex project.
